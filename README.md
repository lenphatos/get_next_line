This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.


## Deployment

To use the function in your code, simply include its header

```c
  #include "get_next_line.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the source files and the required flag

```bash
  get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
```
